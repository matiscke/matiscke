# Hi, I'm Martin

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Steward Observatory, University of Arizona](https://www.as.arizona.edu/) in Tucson, AZ.  

I study exoplanets and their formation using space- and ground-based telescopes, supercomputer simulations, and statistical methods sprinkled with a little machine learning. I'm interested in open and reproducible science, as well as in how we scientists can help address the climate crisis. 

You can find out more about my background and research on [my webpage](https://matiscke.github.io).
