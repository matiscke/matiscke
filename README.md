I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Steward Observatory, University of Arizona](https://www.as.arizona.edu/) in Tucson, AZ.  

I study exoplanets and their formation using [space- and ground-based telescopes](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/abbe03), [supercomputer simulations](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202038554), and [statistical methods sprinkled with a little machine learning](https://doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202140551). I'm interested in open and reproducible science, as well as in how we scientists can help address the climate crisis. 

You can find out more about my background and research on [my webpage](https://matiscke.github.io).
